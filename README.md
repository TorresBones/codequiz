# Code Quiz App

## Description

Challenge Module 04 - Web APIs. This week I built a web code quiz from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This project made me really research, to not only figure out what the error was but to also fix the error I continued to make. I am not only proud of my work this week but this week I found a new appreciation for the process. I am really enjoying this bootcamp and I know there is still a lot to come. Enjoy testing my quiz app.

## Usage

For you to use this page first, you need to press the start quiz button. Then you begin to answer the questions by clicking on the answer you believe to be correct. Keep in mind that every wrong answer will penalize you and deductime 10 seconds from the 60 second timer that you have to answer all 5 questions. When you answer all 5 questions the page will give you your score. You have the option to save your score by inputing your initials and you also have the ability to see all the scores that were saved by pior users.
